My current research focuses on xxx. Before coming to RPI, I obtained B.S. in Physics, National Elite Program, from [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/en/main.psp), I have worked as an undergraduate research assistant in [Prof. Xiaoyong Wang](https://sps.nju.edu.cn/)'s Single-Particle Spectroscopy Laboratory. 

Besides research, I am fan of basketball, skiing and oil painting. My favourite NBA player is *LeBron James* and my favourite Impressionist painters are *Pierre-Auguste Renoir* and *Edgar Degas*. I have been to famous ski resorts like Aspen, Killington and Lake Tahoe, I really enjoy the stunning views from the top of the mountains.

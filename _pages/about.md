I am a master student with double majors at [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute](https://www.rpi.edu). I have conducted 1-year research in the [Mathematical Sciences Department](https://science.rpi.edu/mathematical-sciences), advised by [Prof. Yangyang Xu](https://xu-yangyang.github.io/), I have also conducted 3-years research in the [Chemical and Biological Engineering Department](https://cbe.rpi.edu/) advised by [Prof. Sufei Shi](https://sufei-shi.weebly.com/people.html). A short version of my resume could be found [here](https://msnlbj236.github.io/files/Optical_Resume_Vivian_Miao_Feb27.pdf) .

**Research Interest**
Generalizable Model Predictive Control; Spatial-temporal Modeling of Interdependent Urban Systems; Stochastic Control

My current research focuses on implementing generalizable Model Predictive Control policies that can be integrated with existing building HVAC control frameworks, and spatial-temporal graph neural networks to infer interactions in urban systems such as building and transportation. Before coming to CMU, I obtained M.S. in Structural Engineering, and B.S in Civil Engineering, both from [Dalian University of Technology](https://en.dlut.edu.cn/), fortunated to have been supervised by [Jinping Ou](http://homepage.hit.edu.cn/oujinping) and worked on [optimal sensor placement of deepwater risers](https://milanlx.github.io/files/Master%20Dissertation%20(original).pdf) ([slides](https://milanlx.github.io/files/mastet_thesis_short_version.pdf)). 

Besides research, I am fan of basketball, skiing and oil painting. My favourite NBA player is **LeBron James** and my favourite Impressionist painters are *Pierre-Auguste Renoir* and *Edgar Degas*. I have been to famous ski resorts like Aspen, Killington and Lake Tahoe, I really enjoy the stunning views from the top of the mountains.

I am a master student with double majors at [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute](https://www.rpi.edu). I have conducted 1-year research in the [Mathematical Sciences Department](https://science.rpi.edu/mathematical-sciences), advised by [Prof. Yangyang Xu](https://xu-yangyang.github.io/), I have also conducted 3-years research in the [Chemical and Biological Engineering Department](https://cbe.rpi.edu/) advised by [Prof. Sufei Shi](https://sufei-shi.weebly.com/people.html). A short version of my resume could be found [here](https://msnlbj236.github.io/files/Optical_Resume_Vivian_Miao_Feb27.pdf) .

**Research Interest**: 
Stochastic Optimization, Distributed Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision; Nanoscale Optics & Electronics, Semiconductor Physics, Signal Processing.

My current research is to perform optimization methods and convergence analysis to design new algorithms to solve mathematical problems in machine learning, deep learning and distributed/federated learning and also run numerical experiments with large-scale datasets. 

I also have rich experiences in designing, optimizing and simulating optical and electrical measurement systems with semiconductor physics, optoelectronic devices, photonic crystals and quantum optics. I'm also experienced in cleanroom techniques for device fabrication and characterization.

Before coming to RPI, I obtained B.S. in Physics, National Elite Program, from [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/en/main.psp). I have worked as an undergraduate research assistant in [Prof. Xiaoyong Wang](https://sps.nju.edu.cn/)'s Single-Particle Spectroscopy Laboratory. My undergraduate research was focused on optical studies of time-resolved two-pulse excitation of CsPbI<sub>3</sub> quantum dots, and also temperature dependence of CdSe colloidal quantum dotsâ€™ fluorescence lifetime.

Besides research, I am fan of basketball, skiing, photography and oil painting. My favourite NBA player is *LeBron James* and my favourite Impressionist painters are *Pierre-Auguste Renoir* and *Edgar Degas*. I have been to famous ski resorts like Aspen, Killington and Lake Tahoe, I really enjoy the stunning views from the top of the mountains.
